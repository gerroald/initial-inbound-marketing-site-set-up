# MetroMove OKC — Inbound Marketing Mockup (Full Bundle)

Generated: 2025-09-14

## Contents
- Homepage, Service pages, Quote form, Resource hub
- Service Areas hub with filters
- 13 Service Area pages (cities + neighborhoods)
- Assets folder with placeholders

## Assets
- `logo-placeholder.png` → used in header + favicon
- `city-placeholder.jpg` → hub card image for cities
- `neighborhood-placeholder.jpg` → hub card image for neighborhoods
- `hero-[area].jpg` → hero banner for each service area page

## How to Replace Images
1. Replace `logo-placeholder.png` with your logo (suggested 200×200 PNG).  
2. Replace `city-placeholder.jpg` and `neighborhood-placeholder.jpg` with stock or branded card thumbnails (suggested 400×250).  
3. Replace each `hero-[area].jpg` with a wide banner for that page (suggested 1600×400).  
4. Keep filenames the same so you don’t have to edit HTML.

## Notes
- All pages use consistent header/footer and tokenized CSS.  
- Service Areas Hub shows placeholders for now; update assets for real visuals.  
- Favicon: browser will pick up `logo-placeholder.png` automatically.
